## Data Structures Project 2 - Frequency Distribution

A frequency distribution is a table that displays how many times each an object is present in 
a data set. When computing a data set there are many approaches that we can take, 
here we looked at four different approaches.

Note: When adding entries, if an entry corresponding to the object does not exist, 
we create a new entry with frequency 1. If an entry already exists, we increase 
its frequency by 1.

**Sequential:** we iterate through the objects in the data set, and for each object we add 
to a *list* an entry corresponding to the object and its frequency. 

**Sorted List:** we iterate through the objects in the data set, and for each object we add 
to a *sorted list* an entry corresponding to the object and its frequency. 

**Ordered:** we first sort the data set, then we iterate through the objects taking advantage
of the fact that they are sorted. For each object we add to a *list* an entry corresponding to 
the object and its frequency.

**Map:** we iterate through the objects in the data set, and for each object we add to 
a *map* an entry corresponding to the object and its frequency, taking advantage of the
map's O(n) key look up. 

Testing each strategiesâ€™ time complexity, we find that the Sequential and Sorted List strategies
are O(n^2), while the Ordered and Map strategies are O(n).
